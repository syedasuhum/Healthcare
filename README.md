2. **Image Zooming**: To provide users with a closer look at healthcare products, services, or medical imagery, youâ€™ve implemented an image zooming feature. This functionality enhances the user experience by allowing visitors to explore images in greater detail, which is particularly useful for understanding complex medical content.

3. **Digital Count Animation**: The website includes a digital count animation, which is likely used to display statistics such as the number of patients served, successful treatments, or years of experience. This feature adds a dynamic element to the site, drawing attention to important metrics and achievements.
